# AI Operations Copilot

A multi-tenant business operations SaaS platform where a business imports
operational data, views analytics, asks an AI copilot questions about that
data, receives actionable recommendations, and automates recurring reports.
Built as a portfolio-grade, backend-focused full-stack project demonstrating
Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React/TypeScript, AI model routing and tool
calling, background jobs, security, and testing.

> Status: **Phase 1 — Authentication.** See `RULES.md` for the branching
> and release workflow, and
> [`docs/PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md`](docs/PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md) for the
> full implementation spec this project follows.

## Core Product Loop

Business data → analytics → AI understanding → recommendation →
task/automation → measurable business action.

## Architecture

```
React + TypeScript  ──HTTPS/JSON──>  FastAPI (API / Auth / Domain Modules)
                                          │
                          ┌───────────────┼────────────────┐
                          ▼                                ▼
                    PostgreSQL                        AI Gateway
                   (business data)                 (routing/providers)
                          │                                │
                          ▼                          Groq-hosted models:
                  Redis + Celery                     GPT OSS 20B / 120B
                (background jobs:                     Qwen 3.6 27B (vision)
              reports / imports)
```

The AI Gateway/Model Router is the key differentiator: business logic never
calls a provider SDK directly. All LLM calls go through an internal
`AIService` → `ModelRouter` → `AIProvider` interface, so providers/models can
be swapped without touching domain code.

```

## Local Setup

Prerequisites: Docker and Docker Compose.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in SECRET_KEY and GROQ_API_KEY

docker compose up --build
```

- Backend API: http://localhost:8000 (health check at `/health`)
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173

### Running tests

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run test
```

## Multi-Tenancy & Security

Every organization-owned table carries an `organization_id`; every
service/repository query enforces tenant scope derived from the
authenticated membership context, never from client-supplied input.
Role-based permissions (`OWNER`, `ADMIN`, `MEMBER`) gate write actions.
Passwords are hashed with bcrypt; authentication uses short-lived JWT access
tokens with a refresh-token rotation strategy.

## Development Workflow

This repository follows a Git Flow–style branching model
(`main` / `staging` / `develop` / `release/*` / `feature|task|fix/*`) with
Conventional Commits. **See [`RULES.md`](RULES.md) for the full policy** —
read it before starting any task.

## Roadmap

Development proceeds in phases (see the project specification, Section 27):
Setup → Auth → Core Data → Analytics → AI Gateway → Copilot → Automation →
Imports → Quality → Deployment → Advanced (RAG, additional providers).

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

- Auth is implemented: register (creates an organization + OWNER
  membership), login, JWT access/refresh tokens with rotation-on-refresh,
  logout (refresh-token revocation), `GET /me`, `GET /organizations/current`,
  and role-based (`OWNER`/`ADMIN`/`MEMBER`) authorization scaffolding.
- A user's organization context is fixed at token-issue time to their first
  membership — there is no "switch organization" endpoint yet for users
  belonging to multiple organizations.
- Domain CRUD (customers/products/orders), analytics, and the AI Gateway
  land in subsequent phases per the roadmap above.
